Agri Sphere
This project is an innovative application designed to aid farmers in making informed decisions about crop and fertilizer recommendations and enhancing farm security using AI and machine learning.

Features:

Crop Recommendation:

Utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest the most suitable crops based on soil type, weather conditions, and other relevant agricultural data.
Helps farmers maximize yield and optimize resource use by recommending crops that are best suited for their specific field conditions.

Fertilizer Recommendation:

Analyzes soil health and nutrient levels to provide personalized fertilizer recommendations.
Ensures that crops receive the appropriate nutrients, improving growth and reducing waste from over-fertilization.

Security Feature:

Implements OpenCV for real-time livestock motion detection.
Enhances farm security by sounding an alarm when unexpected livestock movement is detected, helping to prevent theft and keep animals safe.
By integrating advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques, this project aims to support farmers in their daily operations, leading to more efficient and secure agricultural practices.
